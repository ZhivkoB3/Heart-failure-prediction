Github does not load some of the charts from the ipynb so it will be better to use https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ or you can open this link: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ZhivkoB3/Heart-failure-prediction/blob/main/Heart%20failure%20prediction.ipynb !!! <br>

### Abstract:<br>
Heart plays significant role in living organisms. Diagnosis and prediction of heart related diseases requires more precision, perfection and correctness because a little mistake can cause fatigue problem or death of the person, there are numerous death cases related to heart and their counting is increasing exponentially day by day. To deal with the problem there is essential need of prediction system for awareness about diseases. Machine learning is the branch of Artificial Intelligence(AI), it provides prestigious support in predicting any kind of event which take training from natural events. AdaBoost, RandomForest and SVM are widely used in the medical fields.

### Dataset information:<br>
We analyzed a dataset containing the medical records of 299 heart failure patients collected at the Faisalabad Institute of Cardiology and at the Allied Hospital in Faisalabad (Punjab, Pakistan), during Aprilâ€“December 2015 . The patients consisted of 105 women and 194 men, and their ages range between 40 and 95 years old. All 299 patients had left ventricular systolic dysfunction and had previous heart failures that put them in classes III or IV of New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification of the stages of heart failure.

The dataset contains 13 features, which report clinical, body, and lifestyle information, that we briefly describe here. Some features are binary: anaemia, high blood pressure, diabetes, sex, and smoking. The hospital physician considered a patient having anaemia if haematocrit levels were lower than 36%. Unfortunately, the original dataset manuscript provides no definition of high blood pressure.
